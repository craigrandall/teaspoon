# teaspoon (tsp)

Standalone Rust tooling for deterministic, loss-aware mining of Outlook `.pst` and `.msg` files.

Shorthand for teaspoon (i.e. the name of this project) is tsp (i.e. the name of this project's tool), which is "pst" backwards. (ツ)

## Current status

**M0 — architecture/research baseline:** established. Five of six ADRs are Accepted; ADR-0006 (independent differential verification) remains Proposed until that verification work actually happens.

**M1 — PST feasibility spike: complete**, within the limits of `outlook-pst` v1.2.0's public API. A small read-only CLI (`tsp`) exercises the Microsoft Rust PST implementation: open a PST, reach the message store/IPM subtree, traverse folders, enumerate messages, and inspect raw message properties, plus aggregate message-class, body-availability, recipient-count/type, and attachment-count/classification diagnostics — all without emitting any message content.

- P1 through P4b are done and verified on Windows against a real PST fixture deliberately enhanced to cover plain/RTF bodies, a BCC recipient, an embedded-message attachment, and an OLE attachment — see `docs/verification/m1-results.md`.
- Zero-byte and by-reference attachments were explicitly excluded as fixture goals (empirically impractical to compose / obsolete in modern email) — see `docs/verification/m1-results.md` for the documented rationale. The classification code for both remains.
- Opening/traversing embedded-message or OLE attachment *content* was investigated (P4c) and found not achievable through `outlook-pst` v1.2.0's public API — accepted as M1's practical ceiling, not a defect. `tsp` correctly detects and counts these attachments; it can't open them.

This is deliberately **not** the production miner and does not yet emit Markdown or extract body/attachment content.

## Design principles

1. `.pst` and `.msg` are input formats, not the domain model.
2. Format adapters produce a common Outlook-item representation.
3. Markdown is a projection, not the canonical representation.
4. Unknown/unmapped properties are preserved or reported rather than silently discarded.
5. Extraction loss is explicit.
6. Source provenance is part of the output model.
7. Evidence distinguishes specification support, implementation support, tests, and independent verification.

## M1 usage

```powershell
cargo run --release -- .\sample.pst
```

A real PST fixture is required to perform the behavioral portion of M1. No personal PST is embedded in this repository.

## Important limitation

M1 establishes the PST ingestion seam; it does **not** yet prove complete extraction fidelity. Markdown rendering, attachment byte preservation, named-property normalization, body extraction, and differential validation remain future work.
